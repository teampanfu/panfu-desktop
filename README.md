## Introduction

This is the official desktop application of [Panfu.us](https://www.panfu.us), with built-in Flash Player.

It allows you to continue playing Panfu after the Flash Player has been removed from all major browsers.

**NOTE: We are already working on an HTML5 version of Panfu and will no longer support the desktop application once it is released.**

## Contributing

We are not planning any further major changes to the desktop application, however, you can fork the repository and update it yourself.

Please do not remove the credits.
